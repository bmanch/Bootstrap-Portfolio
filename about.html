  					<h1>About Me</h1>

				<img id="profilePic" src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="profile pic">
				<p>Brian spent the first twenty-three years of his life in Southern California. But in 2010, he moved to the other coast, taking up residence in Durham, North Carolina. Brian studied religion and classics during his undergraduate years at Biola University. He continued his study of religion at Duke University, obtaining a Master’s degree in 2013. For work, Brian has primarily been involved in the test prep industry since 2009. Besides tutoring and teaching courses for high schoolers for the SAT and the ACT (among other subjects), Brian has also spent time writing curriculum, serving as a school liaison, and much more. Having spent the majority of his life in the humanities—and, therefore, in the realm of abstract ideas—Brian decided in 2017 that he wanted to apply his skills with logic and language to a concrete realm: web applications. So, Brian enrolled in a coding bootcamp hosted by the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He’ll become well-versed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with several front end and back end technologies. Come August, 2017, he’ll be ready to enter the work force as a full-stack developer.</p>

				<p>When he’s not coding or teaching, Brian enjoys time with his spouse, Kat, who herself is pursuing a Doctorate of Nursing Practice. Once finished, Kat will become a practicing midwife. The two are kept busy with their Siberian Husky, Jax. For fun, Brian likes to read, watch shows (particularly period pieces and sci-fi), and watch sports (especially basketball). He also likes to jog, play basketball, drum, and climb. Brian and Kat have climbed some pretty cool outdoor features, including one of the Flat Irons in Boulder, Colorado. Brian is always looking for laughs and good conversation, something he hopes to find in work as well as in life.</p>
